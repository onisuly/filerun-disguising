# FileRun Plugin: Disguising
Plugin for [FileRun](https://www.filerun.com/) to disguise files as pictures.


> WHY THIS? For my personal purpose, downloading big files through corporate network.

# Installation
- Copy the "disguising" folder inside your FileRun installation folder's "customizables/plugins" folder.
- Open FileRun's control panel, add your picture's path under "Files" -> "Plugins" -> "Disguising as Picture" -> "Path to Picture"
- You might need to clear your browser's cache to see the new "Open with.." option. (Simply press Ctrl+F5 works for me)
